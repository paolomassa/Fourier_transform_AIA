# Efficient identification of pre-flare features in SDO/AIA images through use of spatial Fourier transforms

In this demostration code we show how to compute Fourier components ("visibilites") associated with an SDO/AIA image. We also show how to reconstruct the AIA image from the synthetic visibility values by means of a Maximum Entropy Method (MEM_GE; Massa et al., 2020)
